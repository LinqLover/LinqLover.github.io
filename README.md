# LinqLover.github.io

This repo servers my [homepage](https://linqlover.github.io/).
Note that the sources for the homepage are not maintained in this repo but in <http://github.com/LinqLover/LinqLover> (because I think having one special repo should be enough, but unfortunately GitHub thinks differently, so I set up a CI job that automatically mirrors my GitHub Pages build from there to here...)
